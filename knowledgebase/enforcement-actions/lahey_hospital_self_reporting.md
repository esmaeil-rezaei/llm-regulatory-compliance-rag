# Enforcement Action: Lahey Hospital & Medical Center - Lost CT Scanner

## Case Summary

**Regulating Body:** U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office for Civil Rights (OCR)
**Entity:** Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, Inc.
**Date of Resolution:** October 29, 2019
**Violated Regulation:** HIPAA Security Rule
**Core Issue:** Failure to conduct a thorough risk analysis and implement physical safeguards for a portable device containing ePHI.
**Outcome:** $1,000,000 monetary settlement and a corrective action plan. Notably, this settlement resulted from a self-reported breach.

## Detailed Case Background

Lahey Hospital & Medical Center is a nonprofit, physician-led teaching hospital in Burlington, Massachusetts. In 2011, a portable computed tomography (CT) scanner used for research was removed from the hospital's premises without authorization. The device contained the electronic protected health information (ePHI) of 599 individuals, including names, dates of birth, diagnoses, and Social Security numbers.

The device was subsequently lost. Lahey self-reported the breach to OCR, triggering an investigation. While the breach itself involved a relatively small number of records, the OCR investigation uncovered longstanding, systemic failures in Lahey's compliance program that extended far beyond this single incident.

## Investigation Findings & Specific Violations

The multi-year investigation revealed that Lahey had failed to comply with the HIPAA Security Rule over an extended period:

*   **Failure to Conduct an Accurate and Thorough Risk Analysis (45 C.F.R. § 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)):** Lahey had not identified all equipment that stored, recorded, or transmitted ePHI—including its portable devices like the CT scanner—as part of its risk analysis process. This failure meant the risks to these devices were never assessed or mitigated.

*   **Failure to Implement Physical Safeguards for Workstations That Access ePHI (45 C.F.R. § 164.310(c)):** Lahey lacked policies and procedures to govern the receipt and removal of hardware and electronic media that contain ePHI into and out of its facilities. There were no sufficient physical safeguards, such as tracking or monitoring, to prevent the theft or loss of portable equipment.

*   **Failure to Implement Policies and Procedures to Address Security Incident Response and Reporting (45 C.F.R. § 164.308(a)(6)(i)):** While Lahey self-reported the breach, its internal policies and procedures for identifying, responding to, and reporting security incidents were found to be insufficient.

## Penalties and Corrective Action Plan

Lahey agreed to pay **$1,000,000** to OCR and enter into a two-year corrective action plan. The CAP required:

1.  **Comprehensive Risk Analysis:** Perform a complete and thorough analysis of security risks and vulnerabilities to all ePHI across the organization.
2.  **Risk Management Plan:** Develop and implement a detailed risk management plan to address and mitigate identified security risks.
3.  **Revised Policies and Procedures:** Develop, implement, and distribute new Security Rule policies and procedures, with a specific focus on device and media controls.
4.  **Training:** Provide comprehensive security training to all workforce members.
5.  **Reporting:** Submit annual compliance reports to OCR for two years.

## Key Takeaways for Compliance

1.  **Self-Reporting Does Not Absolve Liability:** While self-reporting a breach is mandatory and can be viewed favorably, it does not shield an organization from penalties if the underlying cause is systemic non-compliance. The OCR investigation will always look beyond the single incident.
2.  **Physical Security is a Critical Component:** The HIPAA Security Rule is not just about firewalls and encryption. It encompasses physical controls for all devices that handle ePHI. Organizations must maintain an inventory of all hardware and have strict policies for moving equipment.
3.  **The "Small" Breach Can Reveal "Big" Problems:** A breach affecting fewer than 500 individuals (a "small" breach under HHS reporting rules) can still trigger a full-scale investigation that uncovers enterprise-wide failures, leading to severe financial and reputational consequences.
4.  **Compliance is Continuous:** The Lahey investigation lasted for years, examining policies and practices both before and after the breach. OCR expects compliance to be an ongoing, dynamic process, not a one-time project.
