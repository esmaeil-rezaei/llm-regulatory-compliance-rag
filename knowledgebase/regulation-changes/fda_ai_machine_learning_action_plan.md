# FDA Action Plan for AI/ML-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)

## Change Notice Summary

*   **Regulation Affected:** FDA's regulatory framework for medical devices (specifically Software as a Medical Device - SaMD)
*   **Issuing Agency:** U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)
*   **Publication Date:** January 12, 2021
*   **Status:** Discussion Paper and Proposed Action Plan; **Not a final rule.** Guides current FDA thinking and foreshadows future regulatory changes.

## Overview of the Change

The FDA's 2019 discussion paper, "Proposed Regulatory Framework for Modifications to Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device," outlined a potential approach for regulating adaptive AI. The 2021 "Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) Action Plan" is the FDA's official response to stakeholder feedback on that paper and outlines a multi-pronged approach to overseeing this rapidly evolving technology. It signals the agency's intent to create a new, agile pathway for AI that "learns" in the real world.

## Key Proposed Changes and Future Directions

### 1. Predetermined Change Control Plans (PCCP) - The Core Concept

*   **The Problem:** Traditional medical devices are "locked" after approval. An AI algorithm that continues to learn and adapt ("adaptive" or "continuously learning" AI) would, under old rules, require a new submission for every update, stifling innovation.
*   **The Proposed Solution:** The FDA is developing a framework where manufacturers would submit a **Predetermined Change Control Plan** as part of their initial premarket submission.
    *   **SaMD Pre-Specifications (SPS):** This defines the *"what"* – the types of anticipated modifications (e.g., to the algorithm's input data, architecture, or performance).
    *   **Algorithm Change Protocol (ACP):** This defines the *"how"* – the specific methods that will be used to implement those changes in a controlled manner that manages risk.
*   **Impact:** This would allow a certified AI model to improve itself within pre-approved boundaries without requiring a new FDA submission for every iterative update.

### 2. Focus on Good Machine Learning Practices (GMLP)

*   **Change:** The FDA emphasizes that the foundation of a trustworthy AI/ML-based SaMD is built on GMLP. This encompasses the entire lifecycle: data management, feature extraction, training, interpretability, evaluation, and documentation.
*   **Impact:** Manufacturers will need to demonstrate robust, well-documented development processes that ensure algorithm fairness, robustness, and transparency. The FDA may eventually recognize consensus standards for GMLP.

### 3. Patient-Centered Approach and Transparency

*   **Change:** The Action Plan highlights the importance of transparency to users (clinicians and patients). This includes:
    *   **Device Performance Monitoring:** Ensuring users understand the product’s performance, including its strengths and limitations.
    *   **User Trust:** The FDA is interested in how manufacturers convey the role of human review and the basis for the AI's recommendations.
*   **Impact:** "Black box" algorithms may face greater scrutiny. Manufacturers will need to invest in Explainable AI (XAI) and clear user interface design to communicate how the AI works.

### 4. Regulatory Science Research into AI/ML

*   **Change:** The FDA is actively conducting research into how to best evaluate and monitor AI/ML-based SaMD. This includes methods for:
    *   Evaluating and mitigating algorithmic bias.
    *   Ensuring model robustness across different clinical environments.
    *   Managing "dataset shift" (when real-world data diverges from training data).
*   **Impact:** The regulatory requirements for premarket review and postmarket monitoring will continue to evolve based on the findings of this research.

## Action Items for Compliance (Preparing for the Future)

1.  **Adopt GMLP Now:** Integrate Good Machine Learning Practices into your AI development lifecycle. Document everything meticulously, from data provenance and labeling to model training and testing.
2.  **Start Drafting a PCCP:** Even as a thought exercise, begin defining what a Predetermined Change Control Plan would look like for your product. What will change, and how will you control and monitor those changes safely?
3.  **Plan for Real-World Performance Monitoring:** Develop a strategy for continuous post-market monitoring of your algorithm's performance to detect drift, bias, or performance degradation.
4.  **Engage with the FDA:** Proactively participate in the FDA's discussion workshops and pilot programs for AI/ML-based SaMD. Early and often collaboration is key to navigating this new regulatory pathway.
5.  **Prioritize Transparency:** Build tools that help users understand your AI's output and invest in clear labeling and instructions for use.
