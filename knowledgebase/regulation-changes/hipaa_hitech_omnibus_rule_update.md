## Change Notice Summary

*   **Regulation Affected:** HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Enforcement Rules; HITECH Act Breach Notification Rule
*   **Issuing Agency:** U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office for Civil Rights (OCR)
*   **Effective Date:** March 26, 2013
*   **Compliance Deadline:** September 23, 2013
*   **Status:** Final Rule; Active Enforcement

## Overview of the Change

The HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, published on January 25, 2013, was the most significant set of modifications to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules since their inception. It was enacted to implement various provisions of the HITECH Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). This rule dramatically strengthened the privacy and security protections for health information, outlined in the previous summaries, and marked a pivotal shift in the compliance landscape.

## Key Changes and Amendments

### 1. Direct Liability for Business Associates

*   **Previous Stance:** Business Associates (BAs) were only contractually obligated to Covered Entities (CEs) via a Business Associate Agreement (BAA). OCR could only enforce against the CE.
*   **Change:** The Omnibus Rule made BAs directly liable for compliance with specific provisions of the HIPAA Security Rule and for how they use and disclose PHI under the Privacy Rule. This means OCR can now audit and fine BAs directly for non-compliance.
*   **Impact:** This fundamentally altered the risk profile for any vendor handling PHI (e.g., cloud storage providers, SaaS platforms, IT consultants, shredding companies). Every BA must now have its own full-fledged HIPAA compliance program.

### 2. The "Harm Threshold" Replaced with a Mandatory Risk Assessment

*   **Previous Stance (Interim Final Rule):** The breach notification rule used a "harm threshold." Notification was only required if the breach posed a significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to the individual.
*   **Change:** The Omnibus Rule eliminated the harm threshold and replaced it with an objective standard. Now, any impermissible use or disclosure of PHI is **presumed to be a breach** unless the CE or BA can demonstrate through a formal **Breach Risk Assessment** that there is a "low probability that the PHI has been compromised."
*   **The Four-Factor Risk Assessment:** To prove low probability, an organization must document an assessment of at least these four factors:
    1.  The nature and extent of the PHI involved, including the types of identifiers and the likelihood of re-identification.
    2.  The unauthorized person who used the PHI or to whom the disclosure was made.
    3.  Whether the PHI was actually acquired or viewed.
    4.  The extent to which the risk to the PHI has been mitigated.
*   **Impact:** This made breach notification much more likely. It forced organizations to implement a rigorous, documented process for evaluating every security incident. The burden of proof shifted from "proving harm" to "proving no low probability of compromise."

### 3. Strengthened Patient Rights

*   **Right to Access:** Patients' right to access their PHI was strengthened, and the fee structure for providing copies was capped to a reasonable, cost-based fee.
*   **Restrictions on Disclosures:** If a patient pays out-of-pocket in full for a service, they can now restrict disclosures about that service to their health plan.
*   **Third-Party Requests:** Patients can request their PHI be sent directly to a third party (e.g., another provider, a wellness app) in an electronic format.

### 4. Enhanced Enforcement and Higher Penalties

*   **Change:** The rule formally incorporated the HITECH Act's tiered penalty structure (ranging from $100 to $1.5 million per violation category) and made penalties mandatory for violations due to willful neglect.
*   **Impact:** The financial risk of non-compliance increased exponentially, moving OCR from an educator to an enforcer.

## Action Items for Compliance

1.  **Review and Update BAAs:** All Business Associate Agreements must be updated to reflect the new provisions and direct liability.
2.  **Develop a Breach Risk Assessment Protocol:** Create a standardized form and process for evaluating every security incident against the four factors.
3.  **Update Notice of Privacy Practices:** Update this document to reflect new patient rights and re-distribute it.
4.  **Train Workforce:** Conduct comprehensive training for all employees on the new rules, especially the changed definition of a breach.
5.  **Extend Compliance Programs:** Business Associates must develop full privacy and security compliance programs, including policies, procedures, and training.
